# Cluster-spam-comments-
This project aims to detect spam comments in YouTube videos using K-means clustering. It analyzes user behavior and comment features such as duplicate count, number of videos commented, and comment length. By clustering the data, it identifies clusters with a high number of duplicate comments, which are likely to contain spammers. The project provides a 3D visualization of the clusters and their boundaries, enabling easy interpretation and identification of suspicious patterns. The code is implemented in Python and utilizes libraries such as pandas, scikit-learn, and matplotlib.
